FunBallRace

Game developed for a company entrance exam.
Took 3h 45 min approx to develop
The most difficult task would be the time constraint maybe since the code and game are actually quite simple.
There are tons of ways of improving this game:
- Better platforms with no "teleport" by having the ball stop completely when on top (only on top) a platform
- A gauge that allows the player to measure the strength of the shot so he can learn and progress faster
- More obstacles with variations like ramps or pipes
- Multiplayer race mode with/without collision between players
- Timer so you can't stay on top of a platform for too long or overall level timer

and many many more.
 
However if I could improve one only thing would be to give the players the ability to chose the angle from which
the ball is shot. This could be done without extra inputs by doing the shot in two taps, one for the angle, the other
for the force. Just this would allow players to think more creatively by skipping platforms or even try some trickshots
against obstacles to reach a platform you are not supposed to.
Adding to that if by dragging the screen they could have 3D control over the shot would be also an interesting approach.

It is indeed taxing to have so little time to develop a game so I focused on a simple mechanic and through the unity physics
let the engine do the work. The reference given had this properties that I tried to put also in this game.

- One unic input
- Linear
- Physics based
- Moving obstacles

Controls and rules:

The game is really simple, just hold space to charge your jump and release to perform it.

If you contact with a platform you will be teleported on top of it and you can continue jumping.
Fail to reach one and you will have to start over again.

Have fun!
